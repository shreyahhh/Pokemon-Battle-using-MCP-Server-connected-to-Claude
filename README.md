## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn (ASGI server)
*   **AI Integration:** Anthropic's Claude API, custom AI server (`ai_server.py`) and client (`ai_client.py`)
*   **External API:** PokeAPI
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (served by FastAPI)
*   **Dependencies:** python-dotenv, httpx, websockets, Jinja2

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up your Anthropic API Key:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    *   Add your Anthropic API key in the following format:
        ```
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    **Note:** For security, it's recommended to manage API keys using environment variables provided by your hosting environment rather than storing them in a `.env` file, especially in production.

6.  **Run the AI Server:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn ai_server:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

7.  **Run the Main Game Server:**
    Open a **new terminal** in the project root (and activate the virtual environment if necessary) and run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8080
    ```

8.  **Open the game in your browser:**
    Go to `http://localhost:8080`

## Project Structure

*   `server.py`: Main FastAPI application handling game logic and serving the frontend.
*   `ai_server.py`: FastAPI application handling communication with the Anthropic API.
*   `ai_client.py`: Python client library used by `server.py` to communicate with `ai_server.py`.
*   `index.html`: The main frontend HTML file.
*   `static/`: Directory for static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images - although currently only the directory is present).
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies.
*   `api.env`: Environment file to load the API key (should be added to `.gitignore`).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Features

*   **Pokemon Catching:** Catch random Pokemon to build your team.
*   **Pokemon Battles:** Turn-based battles against a random opponent Pokemon.
*   **AI Battle Descriptions:** Creative commentary for battle actions generated by Anthropic's Claude.
*   **AI Attack Recommendations:** Get AI suggestions for the best move to use in battle.
*   **AI Pokemon Personalities:** Each caught Pokemon gets a unique, AI-generated personality trait or backstory.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Game state and messages updated via WebSocket.
*   **Responsive UI:** Basic UI adjustments for better display of caught Pokemon.
